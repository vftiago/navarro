### Update - 2025-12-06 3:45 PM

**Summary**: Performance optimization - Implemented batch dispatch mechanism and created comprehensive performance analysis

**Git Changes**:
- Modified: src/App.tsx, src/state/store.ts, src/state/phases/playPhase.ts, src/state/events/eventHandler.ts
- Added: PERFORMANCE_OPTIMIZATION.md, src/state/phases/upkeepPhase.ts
- Deleted: src/state/phases/accessPhase.ts, src/state/phases/encounterPhase.ts
- Current branch: master (commit: aca1190)

**Todo Progress**: 4 completed, 0 in progress, 0 pending
- ✓ Completed: Create batchDispatch function in store.ts
- ✓ Completed: Update playPhase to use batchDispatch
- ✓ Completed: Update event handler to use batchDispatch
- ✓ Completed: Verify TypeScript compilation

**Issues Encountered**:
1. Sub-second freeze persists when playing cards despite batching implementation
2. Freeze occurs between card exit animation completing (200ms) and visual state update
3. User reports clear performance degradation compared to pre-refactor experience

**Solutions Implemented**:

1. **Batch Dispatch Mechanism** (src/state/store.ts:58-68)
   - Created `batchDispatch()` function to apply multiple actions in single Zustand update
   - Reduces N sequential re-renders to 1 atomic update
   - Applied multiple actions through single `rootReducer` loop

2. **Event Handler Batching** (src/state/events/eventHandler.ts)
   - PLAYER_PLAY_CARD: Batched setPendingAction + setTurnCurrentPhase (2→1 update)
   - PLAYER_INITIATE_RUN: Batched setPendingAction + setTurnCurrentPhase (2→1 update)

3. **Play Phase Batching** (src/state/phases/playPhase.ts)
   - Initial play actions: Batched 4 actions into 1 update
   - Zone movements: Batched N+1 actions into 1 update  
   - Phase transitions: Batched 2 actions into 1 update
   - Reduced from 12+ sequential dispatches to 3-4 batched updates

4. **useShallow Optimization** (src/App.tsx)
   - Combined 4 separate useGameStore calls into single call with useShallow
   - Prevents unnecessary re-renders when unrelated state changes

5. **Upkeep Phase Architecture** (completed earlier in session)
   - Added TurnPhase.Upkeep between Draw and Main
   - Created ON_UPKEEP trigger moment to replace ON_TURN_START
   - Main phase now pure waiting state, can be re-entered safely
   - Fixes bug where ON_TURN_START fired multiple times per turn

**Performance Analysis Created**:
- Documented 30+ potential optimizations in PERFORMANCE_OPTIMIZATION.md
- Categorized by impact: High (H1-H5), Medium (M1-M5), Low (L1-L3)
- Included aggressive options (A1-A6) and experimental approaches (E1-E4)
- Identified root causes:
  - Framer Motion layout prop triggering expensive FLIP calculations
  - Global re-render storm (21-40 React render cycles per card play)
  - Synchronous phase execution blocking main thread
  - setTimeout delay making freeze more noticeable

**Key Findings**:
- Batching reduced re-renders from 12+ to 3-4, but freeze persists
- Likely culprits: Framer Motion layout recalculations, component re-render overhead
- Recommended next steps: queueMicrotask + remove layout prop + memoization

**Code Changes**:
```typescript
// New batchDispatch function
export const batchDispatch = (actions: GameAction[]): void => {
  let state = getGameState();
  for (const action of actions) {
    state = rootReducer(state, action);
  }
  useGameStore.setState(state, undefined, "BATCH_DISPATCH");
};

// Updated playPhase with batching
batchDispatch([
  modifyClicks(-1),
  removeCardFromHand(pendingAction.handIndex),
  addCardToPlayed(card),
  clearPendingAction(),
]);

// Updated event handler
batchDispatch([
  setPendingAction({ cardId, handIndex, type: "PLAY_CARD" }),
  setTurnCurrentPhase(TurnPhase.Play),
]);
```

**Next Actions**:
- Awaiting user decision on which optimizations to implement
- Recommended: H1 (queueMicrotask) + H2 (remove layout) + H3 (memoize calculations)
- Alternative: Profile with React DevTools to identify exact bottleneck

**Session Status**: Active, awaiting user input on optimization strategy
